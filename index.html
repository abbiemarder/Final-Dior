                            <p>Christian Ernest Dior was born and raised in Normandy, France andÂ moved to Paris with his
                                parents when he was ten years old. He was one of seven children in his family and was
                                the second born.
                                His parents were Maurice and Madeleine in the town of Granville. Dior was always
                                interested in art but
                                his father insisted on
                                a
                                good education.</p>

                                Politics which prepared him for the next step in his life. Dior always wished to be a

                                <p>Christian Dior is known to be a creative and successful designer. I love to ultilize
                                    my creativity in
                                    everything that I do so Dior truly inspires me. As I learned his backstory I
                                    noticied that we had more
                                    things in common than I orignally believed. At the beginning of his journey, he
                                    struggled to find the
                                    path that he wanted to take but as he got older he learned that he should go for his
                                    passion. </p>
